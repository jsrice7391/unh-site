            <p> Sometimes when I build things, I get half way through them and then wonder "What the heck was I thinking?" after I get past that step, I start diving into at-least the intention of the project and then find the deeper meaning. I try to do
                things in which I will atleast learn something from the experiecne. It becomes more about what I take away from something vs. the failure or success of the given project </p>
            <p>
                I believe that sometimes the worst thing about ideas is that at their orginal concept they are great and are life changing, but once they get down on paper people quickly think about if it is a good idea or not, or maybe even "What happens if people do
                no like it?" The saddest parts of ideas are the ones that were great, but died at the hands of doubt and validation.</p>
